# ‚ö° Electric ATV for SAE INDIA eBAJA Competition (2024 & 2025)

## üìñ Project Overview
This project involved designing, manufacturing, and testing an **Electric All-Terrain Vehicle (ATV)** to participate in the **SAE INDIA eBAJA Competition** for the years **2024 & 2025**.  
Our main objective was to **replace the internal combustion engine with a reliable electric powertrain** while ensuring:
- Sufficient **power, torque, and speed** for off-road conditions.
- **Driver safety & comfort** during events like acceleration, maneuverability, and endurance.
- Compliance with SAE rules and standards.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Contributions

### **Powertrain Development**
- Selected and implemented a **4 kW PMSM motor**, **120Ah Li-ion battery pack**, and **10:1 gearbox**.
- Integrated **Battery Management System (BMS)** for cell monitoring and safety.
- Designed and implemented **LV Control Circuit** using **Arduino** for:
  - Brake switch  
  - RTDS (Ready-To-Drive Sound)  
  - TSAL (Tractive System Active Light)  
  - Reverse alarm & lights  
- Installed **DC-DC converter (48V ‚Üí 15V)** to power low-voltage components.

### **Circuit Design & Simulation**
- Designed and simulated **powertrain circuit in MATLAB/Simulink** to validate performance.
- Created wiring diagrams and schematics for HV and LV circuits.
- Learned about **contactor control logic** and pre-charge circuits.

### **Troubleshooting & Problem Solving**
- Diagnosed a major **motor non-response issue** before competition.
- Found that an unnecessary resistance between controller and motor signal wires was preventing motor operation ‚Äî resolved and restored functionality.
- Developed a **systematic debugging checklist** for future troubleshooting.

### **Vehicle Dynamics & Integration**
- Worked closely with **steering, suspension, and brakes teams** for seamless integration.
- Improved **wheel alignment & steering balance** for 2025 vehicle.
- Optimized **suspension mounting positions** to improve ride quality.
